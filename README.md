# WSLNotifications
A powershell script to give the ability to send notifications to Windows 10 desktop from within WSL. I'm not  PS guru so there are likely many things tha tcould be made better about this script.

It's mainly inspired by this article (https://www.raymondcamden.com/2017/09/25/calling-a-powershell-script-from-wsl) and the lack of the ability to use libnotify-bin in WSL to send messages to the systray in Windows.
